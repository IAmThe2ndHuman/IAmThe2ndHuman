# Introduction
I am a human being who lives on Earth. Funny, right?
## About me
I'm a 15 year old male living in Turkey
I like programming in Python and I'm currently learning Dart so that's a plus.

To check out exactly what I've done over the years, visit the timeline on my [website](https://iamthe2ndhuman.github.io/timeline.html)!

# Stuff I've (and my friends) have made
I like to make stuff!

## Apps
I'm fairly new to making apps for Android and iOS so don't expect much here for now.
I will put the source code of apps I've made on GitHub. Head over to my repositories to check them out! (Not all of my apps will be available, sorry!)

Before I started learning how to use Flutter, I used this neat website called [Kodular](https://kodular.io). I've made a LOT of apps with this, and earned some money with ads as well (around 50TRY, not much but still). I would link my Google Play account which has some of my apps still up but like...it's really, **REALLY** cringy so nah.

# Other stuff
## Notes
If my commit count seems awfully low, it's because most of my repositories are private so they don't show up in my commit count. Don't worry, I'm not inactive :pensive:.

I really, r e a l l y like the letter H.

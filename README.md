# Introduction

## About me
I'm a 17 year old male living in a country :scream::scream::scream::scream::scream:  
I like programming in Python (sorry if you like JS) and I'm currently learning Dart so that's a plus.

# Stuff I (and my friends) have made
I like to make stuff!

## Discord Bots
hikari is epic
 - Meon ([Website](https://meonbot.xyz)) ([top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/713066005911568424))
 - I have more but they're private so go away :rage:
## Apps
I have some experience in making apps for Android and iOS.
I will put the source code of apps I've made on GitHub. Head over to my repositories to check them out! (Not all of my apps will be available, sorry!)

# Other stuff
## Notes
If my commit count seems awfully low, it's because it is...:pensive: I should use this site more often..

I really, r e a l l y like the letter H.

I refuse to include a top 5 languages card because most of my actual projects are private and so the card does not reflect my actual top 5 languages.

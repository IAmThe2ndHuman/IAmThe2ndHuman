# Introduction
H
## About me
I'm a 17 year old male 
I like programming in Python, Dart and Rust (probably my favorite of the three but also the one I'm least experienced in).

# Stuff I (and my friends) have made
I like to make stuff!

## Discord Bots
hikari is epic
 - Meon ([Website](https://meonbot.xyz)) ([top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/713066005911568424))
 - I have more but they're private so go away :rage:
## Apps
I have some experience in making apps for Android and iOS.

# Other stuff
## Notes
If my commit count seems awfully low, it's because it is...:pensive: I should use this site more often.. (also I contribute to organizations I'm in more than my own repos)

I really, r e a l l y like the letter H.

I refuse to include a top 5 languages card because most of my actual projects are private and so the card does not reflect my actual top 5 languages.

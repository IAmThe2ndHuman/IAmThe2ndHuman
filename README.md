## About me
I'm a 16 year old male living in a country :scream::scream::scream::scream::scream:  
I like programming in Python (sorry if you like JS) and I'm currently learning Dart so that's a plus.

# Stuff I (and my friends) have made
I like to make stuff!

## Discord Bots
discord.py is epic
 - Meon ([Website](https://iamthe2ndhuman.github.io/meon)) ([top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/713066005911568424))
 - I have more but they're private so go away :rage:
## Apps
I'm fairly new to making apps for Android and iOS so don't expect much here for now.
I will put the source code of apps I've made on GitHub. Head over to my repositories to check them out! (Not all of my apps will be available, sorry!)

Before I started learning how to use Flutter, I used this neat website called [Kodular](https://kodular.io). I've made a LOT of apps with this, and earned some money with ads as well (around 50TRY, not much but still). I would link my Google Play account which has some of my apps still up but like...it's really, **REALLY** cringy so nah.

# Other stuff
## Notes
If my commit count seems awfully low, it's because it is...:pensive: I should use this site more often..

I really, r e a l l y like the letter H.

I refuse to include a top 5 languages card because most of my actual projects are private and so the card does not reflect my actual top 5 languages.
